Aristotle also writes ""...a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about...by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned...""

According to him, there must be some kind of death for a true tragedy. The third element to a tragedy is that it should not be simple, there should be a complex plot. He says ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not the simple but on the complex plan."" The tragedy should have a lot of twists and turns and ups and downs to be a true tragedy.', ""Firstly, the subject of the tragedy must neither be a villain nor a hero. He must be decent, falling between the two extremes and thus allowing the audience to relate to him. Secondly,  the subject's circumstances must worsen and not improve.

Lastly, his downfall must be brought about as the result of an error on his part rather than by a grave sin."", 'The first element is that the main character should not be overly good or bad because that does not possess the qualities of a tragedy.

The third element is that the character should meet their downfall not by doing something wrong, but by having their own personal error.', '    An ideal tragedy has a character whom of which is not good and just, but who experiences disaster from a wrong decision. In addition, it has a a single problem faced, in which there is one plot rather than multiple. An ideal tragedy has a tragic ending that leaves a catastrophic effect on viewers and readers of the tragedy.', 'There are many elements to the ideal tragedy, some of which are the downfall of the main character, a very extravagant plot, and having the characters display emotions such as pity and fear. The ideal tragedy will end with misfortune and is very dramatic. ', 'One element of an ideal tragedy is that a tragedy should organized in a complex way. A second element of tragedy is to have a plot that leads to something being good to bad. The final element of tragedy is when a double traded plot happens and when a catastrophic causes something to be good for the bad. ', '3 elements of an ideal tragedy would be there is one issue and not multiple, it is happening to a person who is in between bad and good, and it ends badly. ', 'As Aristotle analyses what would be the most ideal tragedy, he explained that three of the most important elements of a tragedy are creating a protagonist who is not an entirely evil or outstanding but a normal human man who does not fight a physical villain but his own mistakes or faults. Another important element Aristotle stated was the change in the protagonist\'s fortune from good to bad instead of the reverse, this allows for the reader to relate further with the character and his or her actions. Finally, an ideal tragedy needs to result with a  pleasure relating to a comedy rather than a ""true tragic pleasure.""', ""Aristotle's ideal tragedy is described by  a character of a man who is not good or bad, and he suffers the fate of an accident, which invites pity/fear.  The character should also be wellknown/famous. The plot of a ideal tragedy should be focussed on a single issue and transition from good to bad. The ending must always end in a tragedy without a solution. "", 'Three of the main elements of a great tragedy are as follows: actions that incite pity and fear, a change of fortune from good to bad, and the exclusion of the utter downfall of the villain. Aristotle explains that the feeling of pity and fear is ""the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). In order for one to incite those feelings from an audience, someone who is neither fully good, nor bad, has to fall a misfortune. This misfortune has to come from a good place and change circumstances for the worse. ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty..."" (Aristotle 3). This means that in order to have a good trade, one must have a main character make a costly mistake that causes them great hardship. The last element of a good tragedy is the avoidance of the utter downfall of a villain, because, according to Aristotle, ""...it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (2). And as stated earlier, pity and fear are one of the most necessary components to an ideal tragedy, so if villain dies a horrible death, the story won\'t have the necessary components. If that story has these three main elements - pity and fear, misfortune, and the avoidance of the downfall of a villain, it would make a great tragedy.']",0

', 'The three elements of an ideal tragedy would be; having a complex plan that excite pity and fear onto those experiencing it,  change of fortune from good to bad,  it ending in dramatic tragic effects. The complex plan should excite pity and fear if done right, because if planned out right it falls onto the most vulnerable people. The change of fortune from good to bad is to have someone doing good fall from a high point to an extremely low point, causing the tragedy. Dramatic tragic effects in the end cause the most conflict as to showing everyone how the trade completely changed them.', 'One of the elements Aristotle claims is crucial to constructing an ideal tragedy is the emphasis on building a story out of pity and misfortune. As stated in paragraph 2, Aristotle remarks that "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" Aristotle is explaining how the best method of displaying tragedy in any poem is to put the main characters in a constant state of misfortune, which is meant to drive forward the narrative as it progresses. Next, Aristotle exclaim that the main character in a tragedy should never been considered ""good or bad"", but in between the two extremes. He claims in paragraph 2, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,  but by some error of judgement or frailty"". He emphasizes that the best way to craft a main character in a tragedy is not to witness a good man suffer from misfortune or a bad man pay for his crimes, but a simple man suffer for making mistakes that may be reliable to the reader themselves. Finally, Aristotle suggests that good tragedies must always involve particular families who have evil past. He explains this in paragraph 3 when he states, "" Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Tedious, Forests, Mileage, Theses, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible."" This describes how building narratives based around icons of tragedies enhances the feelings of pity and misfortune when the main characters experience the tragedies themselves.', 'A trade should be based on a plan. It could lead to many endings and marks. It should plot on the certain issues it concerns and why it needs to be stopped. The second rank is based on what trade comes. It can be double and could even change to the complete opposite.', ""Three elements of an ideal tragedy include having one main issue, the story should change from good to bad not from bad to good (it should not have a happy ending), the bad event should occur because of a character's flaws (like mistakes they have made) not because of an outside source or because the character is evil per se."", 'Aristotle described that perfect tragedy should be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan.

A complex plan of a plot is extremely important in order to have an ideal tragedy.  The plot must move from the beginning to the end according to a cramped sequence of events that are to happen.

""Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Tedious, Forests, Mileage, Theses, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible"".  A plot should consist of a charter going from joy to misery as the plot progresses.  A final element in order to form a perfect traded is thought.

The text states,  ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"" This supports my claim because he states that a tragedy should include a complex plan.', ""First, the plot should feature someone who is neither good or bad living a sad and unlucky life because of a mistake.

He believes the character who commits the tragic flaw should be a fair character who is well known, and should be not a great nor terrible person. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, Romeo isn't a villain or an amazing person, but rather a typical teenage boy more than anything else.  In addition, Aristotle believes the tragic flaw should not occur due to immoral behavior by the character, but rather by an error or a mistake. For example, Romeo's tragic flaw came through his impulsive decision to marry Juliet, which wasn't a terrible, immoral act. Lastly, the plot of a tragedy should consist of a good to bad change of fortune. In the beginning of the tragedy, the character should experience something good, but his/her's fortune should turn to something bad towards the end. Overall, the ideas of a neither good nor bad character, an underserving misfortune, and a flow of a good to bad fortune are three of Aristotle's many elements of an ideal tragedy. ""]",0

They will also be scared, because they do not want this to happen to themselves. Lastly,  Aristotle believes that these plays should end tragically or else it is second tiered.  The article states "" The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Forests and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain"" (Aristotle).

""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""(Paragraph. 3) Overall, Aristotle\'s belief of the concept regarding plot is to be an imitation of an action, a single action. Second, the element of the character for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered as neither good nor bad, as a result, should instead be considered as a surprise to the audience of the character\'s morals. ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes.""(Paragraph 2) Aristotle thinks that if the tragic hero were to be better than one to be good or bad, then the tragedy as a whole would be seen as stronger than before. Third, the element of the thought for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered always on the type of situation being given, whether it is an individual who lives in prosperity or an individual who lives in adversity. ""yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.""(Paragraph 2) In terms of thought, the thoughts that should be considered is if the kind of unexpected sort of events happens should they belong to the wealthy or the poor, because of someone\'s poor sense of judgement or by fate. ', 'A perfect tragedy should contain a complex, rather than a simple plan, in which it should induce pity and fear from the audience due to the outcome of a tragic imitation. This should concur as a result of a victorious man suffering with adversity, or an evil man gaining prosperity. A perfect tragedy should also contain aspects in which things go from good to bad, rather bad to good. This should be a consequence of great error or frailty rather than vice. Lastly, the perfect tragedy should be founded on the story of a few houses. Such as the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Tedious, Mileage, and many more.   ', ""A well-made plot shouldn't be too complex and easy to understand.  The tragic hero should be almost an anti-hero, being bad and good at the same time. Lastly, a good tragedy should emit actually emotions. ""]",0

This element really helps to draw in the audience and make them feel the right emotions for the characters. Another element that Aristotle believes to be valid for a tragedy is that the main character should be a normal person, not terribly good nor evil. He describes this as, ""That of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity""(22-23). Having a more normal character makes it easier for the audience to relate to them as well as to feel for them and understand what they are going through.

Lastly, a tragedy should be built on a complex plan. For a complex plan, the audience should feel pity for a character which would later be used against the audience. Trying to reverse the effects of making the audience feel pity to fear is key for a perfect tragedy as ""it is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators."" Poets need to take audiences by surprise because it\'s similar to killing off the main character of a movie, for it would bring in tons of emotion and catch the audience off guard of something they would never expect to happen. All in all, Aristotle tries to convey his point of how to create a perfect tragedy and demonstrates how thoughtful and impactful a tragedy could be.

The thought that it should excite pity and fear is Aristotle saying that it should catch the attention of people and make them interested and intrigued in it, not having people bored and not focusing.

Aristotle wrote, ""it should moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). He not only states that it should create the feeling of pity and fear, but also states that these two feelings are distinctive marks of tragedies. This helps to explain why he stresses how the story should change, ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (3). Tragedies are supposed to be sad and make the reader feel bad for the character which a story from good to bad does, while a story from bad to good  expresses the feeling of achievement and shapes for the better. Lastly he describes the element of how misfortune is not brought by, ""Vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty""(2). He said the character can\'t be a villain because this wouldn\'t be a tragedy and the person couldn\'t be someone known for being good. It must be a renowned and prosperous person whose misfortune happens because he makes a wrong judgment or bad choice instead of something they have always done like a habit. Aristotle made the elements of tragedy, expressing pity and fear, making sure it was good to bad, and that it wasn\'t a normal error of the person rather bad judgment, clear through his writing.', 'Aristotle states that the plot is the most important element of a tragedy; it should incite pity and fear and be complex in its construction. He also states the progression of such a work should be from good to bad, such as a man of great fortune failing miserably. Finally, Aristotle claims that the villain of the story should not be killed as it would demonstrate that the hero prevails, which goes against the idea of a tragedy.']",0

', 'An ideal tragedy must have a replaceable hero, a singular plot, and a plot where the hero\'s own human flaws cause their demise. This is exemplified by Aristotle\'s description of the ideal tragic hero. Paragraph 2 states, ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Tedious, Theses, or other illustrious men of such families."" It\'s imperative to understand that the protagonist of a Greek tragedy and their qualities are some of the defining traits of a tragedy. The protagonist has to speak to a common humanity within the audience in order to have maximum emotional appeal and impact.  The audience will only be distressed at the events the hero is subject to if they can cry with him and relate  to them just like any person. If the protagonist is either someone incredibly saint-like that never makes mistakes that result in conflict or outrageous and medically evil that succeeds because of their malevolent, the audience will not be able to see themselves in the hero because such drastic personalities or situations rarely happen in real life. Because the fundamental plot elements seem fantastical, the audience will feel more removed from the play and will not feel the pain as the hero feels it when they fail, or the triumphant when they succeed. The best way to make a hero human to the audience is to give them nuance. Like most people, the tragic hero should generally strive to do good but get caught up by their own mistakes like pride, anger, lack of judgement, etc. so that they aren\'t bad people but still accountable for their mistakes. It\'s essential to make tragic heroes essentially common men that the audience already identifies with (such as honorable nobility who are still humans without any special or divine powers) who have replaceable motivations and qualities that cause them to fail due to their own actions while still being sympathetic people. Since this reminds the audience of themselves, it will feel all the more tragic when they suffer, which is the point of the tragic play. In order to have the optimal amount of misery, the plot should be singular. This is discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4, which state, ""He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Tedious, Theses, or other illustrious men of such families. ...In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad. ...It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Forests and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This text demonstrates how one single serious plot is necessary for a proper tragic play. A true tragedy must have the complex protagonist endure general failure as well as the associated physical and emotional pain due to their own incorrect actions, and this should be the only plot point in the play to prevent distractions. On the other hand, double plots  often resolve positively without events like major character death or conflict. The idea that the protagonist does not have to endure any of the consequences of their actions and suffer as a result is the complete antithesis of a tragedy. As a result, the audience does not reach catharsis because there are no emotional stakes if everything is fixed by the end. Therefore, they have no lasting negative emotions pertaining to the play.', 'It should be  a complex plan that also excited fear and pity, change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity.', 'Aristotle said that 3 elements of an ideal tragedy are it should have not a simple but a complex plan, it should imitate excite pity and fear, and lastly, it should follow plainly the changes of fortune.', 'Three elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle, are that they excite pity and fear, tell the story of a ""man who is not eminently good"" (who is like the reader), and that man faces severe misfortune due to a mistake.

He states ""It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Forests and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain"". He was saying that a happy ending is more like a comedy and that the ending should be sad. He also says it should follow the downfall of someone who is neither good or bad.  So we don\'t feel pity for the character or so it doesn\'t satisfy us. And finally it should focus on one problem. Aristotle states""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain"". He is saying that it should focus on one problem to make it easier to understand.', '    The ideal tragedy should include a multi-dimensional conflict, a neutral character\'s mistake, and that character\'s fortune turning from good to bad. A conflict that only has one tragic trait is not a tragedy, since it will not have enough dimension to provoke the emotions within an audience that are associated with tragedy, since this kind of conflict ""never satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear"" due to its basic nature (""On Tragedy""). Therefore, the writer(s)  should include multiple traits that build up to form the many different pillars that make a tragedy, since tragedies rarely occur because of a single tragic trait. To follow this conflict outline, the main character in a tragedy should be neither good nor bad, and their misfortune should occur due to a mistake that they\'ve made. This is because ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,"" meaning that it will be easier for the audience to feel pity and sympathize with a character if they can see themselves in that character\'s shoes (""On Tragedy""). The character\'s fortune should also change from good to bad, since this will reflect the same pity in the audience that was aforementioned. When it comes down to why the target feeling is pity, that\'s because pity is the leading feeling that audiences have when reacting to tragedies. After all, tragedies are defined as ""great suffering, destruction, and distress,"" and these types of situations always have emotional consequences (Oxford Dictionary). If a tragedy is unsuccessful in provoking the emotions that come with tragedy, then it clearly would not be the ideal tragedy. ', 'In the first section he says that "" A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"". what he is saying is that sometimes the best tragedy are the ones that the readers are least to expect. this can easily be done by having a build up of some specific characters and have the audience thinking the end will work in the favor of one of the most beloved people in the plot. this is even done in modern times with shows like Game Of Thrones, it in its self pretty much proves his point because the end of the show took many people by surprise and they weren happy with the outcome.

Aristotle also goes on to say that the protagonist in a tragedy should not be someone who is perfect and saint-like, but it also should not be someone who is evil. He says, ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes-that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is borough about not by vice,"" (Paragraph 2).  The final element that, according to Aristotle, makes an ideal tragedy is the change of fortune.

The second element of a tragedy is that the plot should contain a man neither good nor evil whose life falls apart from a mistake. A character should not move from pure happiness to pure misfortune, or vise versa. For example, in paragraph 2, Aristotle states, ""...here remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous...""

Instances like that in movies are predictable which doesn\'t make them tragedies anymore. The last ideal tragedy is spectacle. The spectacle part of tragedy refers to how things are seen. Such as characters, the set up of the movie or play, how they dress and sound and other things along that line. Spectacle can occur in tragedy because everything isn\'t as it seems.

The characters in a tragedy should also not start from a spot of despair and work towards success. While a basic development from fortune to adversity would also not be ideal for a tragedy, adding more complexity to this story and including aspects that encourage fear or pity would contribute to developing an ideal tragedy. The construction of how the characters reach their final downfall is also a significant element of an ideal tragedy. For instance, not only should a character have a level of reliability to them, but they should also meet their downfall in a unfortunate and deserving manner. Often, the story should be planned out so that the character goes into ruin despite their morals or intentions.

A hero how to have a plan on what they should be doing or what they are doing. A hero who has a downfall but knows how to correct his downfall and get back up and try again. Aristotle is one of many things but the three that he is mainly is a great person who has a downfall but knows how to get back up and try again. He is the type of person that even when hard times come he always has a better plan. ', 'They feature a protagonist that is not strictly good or evil, who is brought down not by a villain, but by a mistake or shortcomings. the events in the story evoke feelings of pity and fear.', 'An ideal tragedy must first feature a plot that is complex but has one main point. The plot must excite fear and tragedy as opposed to a comedy style. The story must feature a main character who is good and prestigious or wealthy in society and is well off. The tragedy occurring must be from good to bad and be single in its issue by not having a double plot line. ', 'Aristotle describes an element an ideal tragedy must have is the actions that create pity or fear in the reader. Without those feelings in the reader, it is not a true tragedy. Another element that a tragedy must have is that the hero of the story cannot follow the story line of moving from prosperity to adversity because it does not incite the feelings a true tragedy must have. One last element of an ideal tragedy is the author should not show the downfall of a character who is mainly shown as the villain. This downfall would satisfy the reader but it would not create the feelings which Aristotle believes is essential to a tragedy. ', 'A perfect tragedy should excite feelings of pity and fear, it should not satisfy moral sense and it should not end well for the hero(es).', 'It must have a character that is having a good life that suffers due to a mistake or event, must make the audience feel  bad for the main character, and have a simple plan', 'As described by Aristotle, one element of an ideal tragedy is one that effectively voices it plot through a single lens from which is complex and venturing out into different perspectives instead of and rather than being clear and concise and simplistic to a certain degree. This is supported within the passage in paragraph 2 where it states, ""A perfect tragedy should...be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This quote by Aristotle is comprehending the purpose of the passage to build up the ideal tragedy, and to make the experience for the audience more interesting and worth-while to bring about analogies and comparison on the greatness of tragedies, in general. Another element of an ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, is the use of pity and fear through imitation of certain actions from which  is a persuasive technique used to bring in the audience for more and feel compassion for the main character being affected at hand. Evidence from the text to support this statement is near the beginning of paragraph 2 where it states, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" From this expression by Aristotle, we can sense the urgency of pity and fear to the makeup of a tragedy and from which, in line, feeds into the different objectives of a tragedy and what makes a tragedy ideal to Greek playwrights. Last, but not least, the third element of an ideal tragedy mentioned is to have a tragedy that is of a single reference and reasoning from which is the result of misassumed and misfortune actions rather than of actual bad influence and illicit actions, as seen within paragraph 3 where it states, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double...[i]t should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty.""', ' An ideal tragedy should have a complex plot, and should have a change in fortune from good to bad. The change should come from a great error or mistake. It should incite great emotion  or fear.', ""In Aristotle's ideal tragedy, the emotions pity and fear must be created in the reader. To do this, it must first have a complex plot, not a simple, easily constructed one. This plot must contain a change of fate, which causes the main character's outcome to transition from good to bad. Finally, a true tragedy must have a neutral main character, who's misfortune or ill judgement leads to their downfall. "", 'One element of an ideal tragedy as described by Aristotle is that the tragic hero should be somewhere in between a great person and a horrible person whose downfall is a result of an error in judgement. This will be effective in creating feelings of pity and fear for the reader which are two important moods that should result from a tragedy. Another element of an ideal tragedy that Aristotle described is that the tragic hero should be someone well-known and successful. Aristotle uses the examples of Tedious and Theses because both are of royal descent, helping to once again get across the feeling of fear by showing the reader that someone so fortunate may not always be so lucky. Finally, a feature that Aristotle mentioned that should be included in order to create an ideal tragedy would be that the character’s fortune should go from good to bad as opposed to it going from bad to good. This reverse in fortune would create a feeling of pity for the character as the reader would feel sorry for them as they face their downfall.

He does this when he says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.

He states this when he says ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain."" He then goes on to say that throughout the plot, the change of fortune should go from good to bad. In the last paragraph, Aristotle discusses true tragic endings and how some well know plays are mistaken for tragedies. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy has a complex plot. He states this in the quote ""In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. "" He then moves on to say that these types of tragedies do not have true tragic ends. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy ""is proper rather to Comedy"" and ends with ""those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies....quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This takes away from a true tragedy because in the end, the protagonist must face their downfall.

Another element is described as the actions contained in the tragedy should be those that make people feel pity and fear.

The downfall must come from an error or frailty but not a vice the character. Arranged on a complex plan a tragedy must additionally show actions to imitate both pity and fear into the audience.

A second rule states that the main character must not be a completely good or evil man, but a man who has a few small flaws that lead to disaster. Another very important rule is that the events of the play must progress from good to bad, and it must end terribly for the main character so that those emotions mentioned in rule one are felt clearly.

But it also has to make a change which would be bringing someone from prosperity to adversity. That change would not imitate pity or fear is just to shock us. That would bring the tragedy spirit to it.', 'Three elements of an ideal tragedy as described by Aristotle are a well constructed plot, a character\'s soul, as well as the production/performance. The most important element of an ideal tragedy is based off of the plot. Aristotle says that, "" The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,"" (Aristotle, 3). The outcome of the main character will have come from some sort of great error or frailty, the ideal tragic hero should be an all good man with a very minor flaw in his character, and the entire tragedy should be continued upon this judgement. Aristotle also explains how a the plot should be a very complex plan where the actions of the characters exemplify emotions such as pity and fear with the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. He suggests that the best sorts of a tragedy are the complex plots that arose both pity and fear. He then explains how a good plot must avoid a hero becoming miserable, avoid the transition from misery to happiness for an the antagonist, and also avoid the antagonist to feel happiness and leading into one\'s misery. He simply just believes that the best plot derives from the misfortune of someone and whose future downfall leads to an error in judgement. The second element includes the character\'s actions and personality. To Aristotle, the character must be set up for failure even though this character has the personality of a ""good character."" The show , ""follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear,"" (Aristotle, 2).  Meaning this, the overall sense and focus of the play should not be based on the hero losing his ""good."" Instead, the character must make multiple judgements and go through an entire storyline, not aware of the downfall set right for him. The final element of an ideal tragedy is the spectacle and production itself. Although Aristotle does not go fully into the details regarding this element, in paragraph 3, it is noted that "" A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art, should be of this construction....because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect"" (Aristotle, 3). Rather than explaining the scenic visuals of the play and visual effects of a ""spectacle,"" Aristotle explains that the true spectacle is the dramatic competition and the tragedy in effect. The best endings is one that is unhappy and shocks the audience. ', 'There are many elements that allow a good tragedy. Aristotle explains that a good tragedy should not be arranged on a simple plan , that it should be completed. A good trade should also draw duty and fear from the audience and that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity.', ""The first element describes a man who is considered neither good or bad, yet is brought trade through an error of judgement, not trough immoral or unlawful behavior. His second element explains how a great trade play should have a change of fortune that changes from good to bad. The character should be experiencing positive circumstances, all for it to come falling apart. Lastly, it shouldn't rely on comedic effect, and not have an edging that results in friendship/and or no deaths."", ""An ideal tragedy should go from good to bad, ending on that negative note, and be caused by a character's own fault that sparks the tragedy."", 'According to Aristotle, the ideal tragedy has a morally neutral protagonist, a negative change in fortune caused by weakness or error, and an ending which does not see the complete victory of the protagonist. The first element is essential because it creates an everyday which the audience can sympathize with easily, and therefore feel pity for. The change in fortune must be negative because otherwise the story becomes happy rather than tragic. Finally, the protagonist must not win completely against the villain, because this creates too satisfying an ending.

In doing this, Aristotle indicates that one of the key features of an ideal tragedy involves an individual that is highly prosperous in order to drive his plot even further.

Evidently, all these elements influence the overall idea he expressed that to a perfect tragedy an individual must experience a downfall or a reversal of misfortune.

Aristotle also says that the ""change of fortune"" should go from good to bad, rather than bad to good. he believes a perfect trade should be complex. the expression should change constantly, this is very dramatic.', 'He believes a good tragedy should shock the audience, it should have a plot that makes fortune go from good to bad. The plot should be ended with a catastrophe.', 'Aristotle explains, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."". By this, he means that a tragedy should make the audience feel a lot of different emotions but mostly pity and fear. They should pity the main character but also fear them because they will eventually become bad. Another element he highlights is a lapse in judgment, he writes, ""— that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,5 but by some error of judgment or frailty."". One man cannot be good nor bad but simply make a mistake. A good tragedy is when the man is just a normal person who takes the wrong turn or makes a deadly mistake that results in a series of alarming events. The final element he discusses is an unhappy ending.  Aristotle explains, ""many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending."". Tragedies should end unhappily. The essence of a tragedy is not to get a happy ending or to have everything resolved it is just simply to end.

I think this is because if there are multiple plots, there are more details and actions/events that happen. One plot really helps highlight the tragedy of one specific person or group.  A second element of an ideal tragedy is that the tragedy has to highlight the downfall of a character that readers can relate to. Relating to the character can help the readers feel more understandable of the incident that the character goes through, and because the character has to be reliable to the audience, the audience will see a little part of themselves in the character, which makes them feel pity. A third element of an ideal tragedy is that a tragedy should not resemble a comedy. A tragedy has to be serious, in order for the audience to feel fear, pity, and slight sympathy towards a character. Comedic feelings would cancel out the feelings of fear and pity which would harm the true meaning of a tragedy. ', 'Aristotle describes that the perfect tragedy should be very complex, use actions of pity/fear,  and of course have a distinctive mark of a tragic event.  The idea that the perfect tragedy should be very complex is interesting because he says the more complex the greater the plot satisfies.  Pity and Fear are used to inspire the viewer to relate to themselves. Of course, a tragic event must occur for a tragedy to take place. ', 'The first element of an ideal tragedy would be the characters. They shouldn\'t be too good or evil, because it wouldn\'t be as reliable to the viewer. They should be a middle of the road type of person pretty average but who is also respected and could have something to lose.

They should lose something and have something worth losing otherwise it isn\'t a tragedy and it shouldn\'t be someone else\'s fault that the protagonist losing everything. ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty.""

Lastly, Aristotle explains that a tragedy should be a complex story, not simple.

Then he goes on to state that the events of the tragedy should excite readers and let them feel ""pity"" and ""fear"" which draw the reader in and make them more interested (paragraph two). Lastly, the main character must not be an evil person, but he must also not be a perfect citizen. The main character should have ""...some error of judgement or frailty,"" but he should not be evil (paragraph two). Overall, the three aspects that were mentioned were that the plot should be elaborate, the plot should cause excitement and interest, and the main hero should be a neither evil nor perfect.', 'As Aristotle states, there are many key elements to a tragedy. Aristotle claims that without these key elements, the work can not be considered a tragedy. These elements shape how the plot should look, and what the characters should act like. The first of these elements is a complex plan that aroused both pity and fear. Another key element that relates to this, is how the story should not be morally satisfying. This would make the story irregular and make it even more ""sad"" for a reader. Characters also need to be specific to produce a good tragedy, the main character must start in a high, well regarded position and take a massive fall into a more depressing state.

The creation of pity and fear in the viewers is critical for a play because it is the ""distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" If it instead brings prosperity to adversity, the play doesn\'t invoke pity or fear and the result is just shock to the viewer, which is not the intention. A complex plot is also involved in an ideological tragedy. Tragedies aim to be ""single in tissue, rather than double as maintain."" The plot should also not follow a storyline that goes from bad to good, but actually good to bad.  Lastly, character is another important aspect. Character is usually one that is considered to be a person who is good, but suffers misfortune and even their downfall due to their own judgement, making them very reliable. Usually they are also famous and prosperous, as seen with Tedious and Theses. Therefore, pity and fear, complex plots, and character are all crucial to an ideological tragedy.', 'As described by Aristotle an element of an ideal tragedy would need to have a complex and dramatic plot.

First, Aristotle explains that ""a perfect tragedy should be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"". (Aristotle 2). Aristotle continues by suggesting that the tragedy should ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" and calls this the ""distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle 2). This desire for readers to feel pitiful and fearful leads to Aristotle\'s second element of an ideal tragedy; for it to be emotional. Aristotle claims that an emotional piece ""is proper rather to Comedy,"" suggesting that all tragedies should end with the reader feeling sorrow. (Aristotle 4). Lastly, the author states that the ideal tragedy ""should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (Aristotle 3). Aristotle believes that the ideal tragedy should include ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgment or frailty"" (Aristotle 3).', 'there must be a change of fortune which will shock the reader.

Aristotle emphasizes the idea that there must be an unforeseen misfortune in a great disaster, from good to poor, not bad to good. The audience is moved by this abrupt change of fortune as it creates a sense of pity and concern for the characters. He also assumed that the character would endure a fall due to their own error of judgement in an ideal tragedy. As it should be ""brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" By this approach, the text represented it as being able to alter the audience\'s perception of the personality and behavior of the character. Aristotle also believes that the main character should have ""highly renowned and prosperous"" qualities and characteristics of virtue. This meant that the character should be very prominent and able to honour much admiration and status.', 'Tragic stories have a character that people can relate to in real life.

A man who is not eminently good and just, yet their downfall is caused terror of judgement or frailty. Some examples are Edulis or Theses. This is because they are reliable to the viewers and pity or excitement can not be aroused  from simple adversity to prosperity or prosperity to adversity. Another key element is the plot. It should be a single plot where change of fortune should be from good to bad. Some of the greatest tragedies like the fortunes of Tedious or Alcmaeon can back this up. Lastly, the ending is also a major facet of the ideal tragedy. Although the ending may not satisfy the viewers, if done right, it can be the most tragic like Euripides.', 'The plot should be well constructed and not have two issues but one single one.

Aristotle says ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad."" Aristotle argues that if the fortune changed from bad to good, then it wouldn\'t invoke any feelings of pity in us, as it wouldn\'t be considered a tragedy if a character\'s fortune increased throughout the play, as this would be a good thing. Aristotle also says a good tragedy should portray a character who is somewhere in the middle between being inherently good and inherently bad. He says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes - that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" Essentially, Aristotle is saying that the main character shouldn\'t be too good, as this wouldn\'t invoke any pity, however, the character also shouldn\'t be too evil, or else the audience wouldn\'t feel sorry for him and his bad misfortune. Lastly, Aristotle says a good tragedy should exhibit a character experiencing misfortune due to a flaw in his character, not necessarily because of bad or immoral behavior. He says ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.""

', 'Egyptian Social Structure by History.org talks about the social structure of the Egyptian. The social structure is very similar to the shape of a pyramid. It consisted of 3 main classes.  People such as the scribes were at the top since they ""had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt — they could read and write."" (History 5) Because they had the ability to write and read, they could help with the government. Unlike the scribes, people at the bottom of the pyramid, such as slaves, weren\'t as involved in the government as the higher upper because they didn\'t have the ability to read and write but the ""Boys who learned to read and write could become scribes"".

Under the Pharaohs you have visor, what they do is supervise and make sure taxes are collected, and who they worked with was scribes. What they did was keep government records, these were high level employees because they had a rare skill of reading and writing, as stated here ""Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records.

Below them you have Soldiers and skilled workers, soldiers fight in wars and control domestic uprisings, and when its peaceful they supervise the peasants, farmers, and slaves. Skilled workers are physicians and craftsmen/women, they are the middle class. Craftsmen make jewelry and other things along that line. And way at the bottom you have farmers and slaves, slaves doing work for the pharaohs and nobles, and farmers doing what farmers do.', 'To summarize the structure of ancient egypt system of government, the structure ancient egypt\'s government was like a social pyramid, a pyramid that could control what they were treated like and how it could impact their whole entire life. Evidence from paragraph 1, "" Egyptian society was structured like a pyramid"" this shows how all of the more powerful, mighty, and rich are all at the top, the artisans, scribes, and skilled workers were in the middle, and how enslaved people, farmers, and unskilled workers were at the bottom. Eruptions at the top of this pyramid were treated more fairly and had many more benefits, the egyptian at the bottom of this social pyramid were treated rou, and didnt have many benefits unlike the pharaoh that was treated like the gods sent him/she down to our earth. It was possible for the citizens at the bottom of the society ladder to move up in the ranks, which could mean like the farmers and headers could move up to maybe on ef the skilled workers, artisans, or even the scribes.

At the middle of the pyramid, soldiers fought in Egypt\'s wars, quieter rebellions, and supervised the laborers who were building the pyramids. Skilled laborers were also in this class; ""Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things.""(History.org, paragraph 9). These people were the utility workers of Egypt: if you wanted something, this was the class most likely to have it.

Each class had responsibilities that they owed to the government to fulfill, and those responsibilities needed to be fulfilled in order to make a functioning society. I know this because in the text that I cited from, the author states multiple scenarios where people of all classes are needed for a functioning government. One of those scenarios that the author states are when soldiers, most commonly part of the middle-class by my guess, go off to war.  Another example that the author says in the text is when farmers, a part of the bottom class, tend their fields, raised their animals, and more. Ancient Egyptian would not be able to live without farmers, because they grew and raised plenty of food. That is why different social classes were involved in the Ancient Egyptian government.', 'The different social classes were involved because in the bottom rank the helped make food and takecare of animals and the slaves would make pryimads and make buildings.

At the top of the pyramid is the Pharaoh, which was like the Egyptian king. Pharaohs were worshipped and admired as they held the most power in the social classes. They were believed to be gods and had many responsibilities, protection is most important. A Pharaoh's assistant is a vizier, vizier made sure taxes were collected and they worked with scribes to keep the government records, they could also read and write. Right below the Pharaoh were nobles and priests. Nobles held government posts and profited from tributes. Priests pleased the gods. Right before the lowest portion of the pyramid are the craftsman, physicians, and merchants. Craftsmen made and sold important supplies like jewelry, pottery, papyrus, products, tools, etc.  These items needed to be seed from the artisans and traders, so merchants sold these goods to the public. At the bottom of the pyramid were the slaves and farmers. Their job was to farm and to work for whoever needed their help.

Because, I mean, THEY\'E GOD. Underneath them is the Pharos. This is due to the fact that people believe that the Pharos were the human versions of the gods. The Pharos held the most responsibility and were the most powerful. They were also buried within stone pyramids. Beneath the Pharos lies the Nobles, who essentially were the government. To quote from the text, they ""profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh."" Oh yeah, and the Priests (also up here with the Nobles) had the job of making sure that the gods were happy, and didn\'t hypothetical cause the destruction of humanity,  but THAT DOES\'T MATTER. Anyway, next is the middle class. the middle class, of course, was in the middle.  It contained craftsmen(men refering to both men and women, plus the possible addition of nonbinary keeps if the term hypothetical existed at the time) and shopkeeper. But what did they make? What did they sell? Well what do YOU think?? Ok, I might understand if you were having trouble figuring out what craftsmen did(which was make things such as jewelry,pottery, and tools by the way),  but shopkeeper??? I think you might be able to find out yourself. O, MOVING N, we have soldiers. Who, in most societies, you might expect to be higher than the middle class, but NE. THEY\'E T THE BOTTOM. Well, not at the bottom, but.. Let\'s just say that in the egyptian society, you\'re either at the top, or at the bottom. And, despite the existence of the middle class, HERE Id Ns INBETWEEN.

Alright, and now the moment in which you bois n goals n nonbinary pals have all been waiting for...the absolute bottom...the lowest of the lows...drumroll please...SLAVES AND FARMERS, ALL!

They were used to work on building projects, and let\'s be honest, were probably treated like crap. And farmers, on the other hand, were...FARMERS! And they did, uh...Very..Farmer-y things. They..THEY EE FARMERS. They also helped build royal monuments, and, to quote from the text, ""paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest"". So, if their yearly harvest were hypothetical around, let\'s say...$10,000, then they\'d be left with...*calculating*...$4,000. So, when it came to taxes, farmers, too, EE TREATED. IE. CAP.

Under the pharaohs, were the pharaohs second in command, known as vizier. They were the people that had to record if taxes were collected. They are supposed to help the pharaohs with his duties. Finally, the last social class within the government are the nobles. They are the only class that can hold government positions. They gained money through the tributes, or gifts paid to the pharaoh. Since we know the pharaoh was basically a god, they were either paying to him or the other core gods of their society, which included Ra, Siris and Isis. Every egyptian, including ""pharaohs to farmers—gave gifts to the gods,"" (Paragraph 7.) Moving on, different social classes were involved in the government due to taxation and bureaucracy. For instance, although the pharaohs and state leaders held control over what the laws were,  people could still choose whether they wanted these laws or not. Additionally, an example of a different social class being involved in the government were farmers. Farmers were taxed up to 60% of their crop to the pharaohs annually, (Paragraph 12.) This allowed the pharaohs and nobles to distribute foods from warehouses if need be, such as in a famine or food shortage. Therefore, this is how the social structure of Egypt was built, as well as how other social classes helped within the government.']",2

These people were in the middle, which meant they do have an important role in Ancient Egypt. But there are not much idealized like the pharaohs. These types of people worked hard also because craftsmen and soldiers always had to work for the pharaohs will. Craftsmen also had to make goods for anybody in Ancient Egypt, and thats a lot to keep up with. But for soldiers they always had to protect Ancient Egypt and the pharaohs most of all. Now all the way at the bottom we have slaves, and the farmers. For them it sway harder to live life then any other person. They would always have high taxes, make sure they did everything for the pharaohs, and also they were against their will for anything. All of these structures how they worked as a government together was very surprising also because they had a great civilization for many years. Text to prove this is that in the article it states ""Egyptian society was trusted like a pyramid"". ""At the top were the gods, such as Ra, Siris, and Isis"". This showed how the structure of their government and society was like a pyramid because there were types of people in every group that made them different. For that reason the pharaohs were always on top of the list because they were more important then any other group then. It also states in the text that ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers"". ""Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war"". ""In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles."" This shows that after all of those nobles and pharaohs there are actually people all the way at the bottom. That have more of a tough time than others and they cannot really choose what they want to do with their life. They cannot ranked equally like the pharaohs or the nobles, because they always worked for these people. This is the structure of the ancient Egyptian government.']",2

In the passage it states, ""The students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control.""

People want to fit  into the crowd so they blindly did the wave along with the other students. However, the students followed their leader, Mr. Jones, as if he was the monarch of a monarchy.  But in the end, Jones showed the students that people naturally want a feeling of superiority over others which could lead to terrible things in the future. In conclusion, people can blindly follow their feeling if it makes them feel superior to others.', ""Jones' group grew so quickly because  people naturally follow groups or crowds. So when people see this 30 person group, they followed, and then others see an even bigger group, and also follow.

The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees. All of the students showed drastic improvement in their academic skills and tremendous motivation."" This shows that they were all excited to join the movement. The reason it was ended was because the sense of pride in the members led to discrimination of people that were not members, showing that their discipline and pride to the mouvement was getting to serious.

Then he made more rules including have to salute each other even out side of class and people where following the crowd and more and more people joined in. It then got to the point where people were taking it too seriously and it was getting too out of hand so he had to shut it down.', 'The experiment developed by extending and the amount of students participating and brought out  exceptional improvement in their educational studies.

As democracy was expelled from the classroom Ron Jones was seem to become more of an authoritarian figure in the classroom as he told the rules and continue to make a very strict résumé for students to be as disciplined as possible. The main concern in this experiment was when he made a slew resembling that of the Nazi regime where students would have to salute to each other even when they were outside his classroom. As the movement gained popularity the new motivated students became a sort of court not letting any nonmembers into the classroom and eventually got over 200 participants.

(3) Sinclair explains that these factories are willing to risk the health of many human beings for some more money. Not only are the factories willing to do this but the employees swell.  Looking at this question of whether or not to use supplies to contaminated meat seems like a very simple answer. However, to the factory workers in the twentieth century, it was not. Not only was it not a simple answer there was no question.  ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it ... . It was too dark in these storage places to see well ... There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner"" (4-5) Sinclair goes on to explain that there was not an option for the workers, and the factory owners knew this.  They knew the workers needed the money to provide for their families.  To add to the atmosphere of the factories Sinclair says, ""With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge"" (1) The people were scared to step up for fear of backlash from their ""family"".

They used the chemistry in the method of rubbing the meat against the soda to change the appearance and smell of the meat to make it more appetizing however, it hides the true condition of the meat.

According to paragraph 3 ""it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."" Signifying this was a repeated process to get the sausage accepted to other countries.  Furthermore, the factory would hide the spoiled meat by ""giving them thirty-percent"" which was done prior to finding hams spoiled from injection.

This conveys that the factory narrowed down the techniques used to hinder the spoiled condition of the meat first done by intensifying the amount of pickle to hide the smell to creating devices and apparatus that extracted the ""bad parts"" (which created the condition) of the meat, in this case the bone.

The factories had the workers put spoiled meat into sausages and they would allow the people to eat them knowing it could get them sick.They also would rub soda so get rid of the smell so that people who were eating it could not tell that it was spoiled. Sinclair claims that jonas had told him ""they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters"".

They would rub the meat with chemicals to try and prevent their consumers from seeing the disgusting meats. They would use a hot iron, to try and disguise the smell of the meat.  If none of that worked, they would cut it up the spoiled meat, mix it with other spoiled meats, and mash it into a sausages.

In the text it states, ""For it was the custom, as they found, whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage."" They chopped up spoiled meat into sausages so that they could still be eaten.

This text evidence tells us that meat was often played with and chemicals were often poured into it so that workers could stop it from smelling and make it be able to be sold again. In conclusions, the meat industry used  many methods so that they didn\'t have to sell fresh meat, so that they could keep selling spoiled meat.

Another way of covering this up is putting it in sausage, as people wouldn\'t notice.', '    In the excerpt from the 1906 novel,""The Jungle"" by Upton Sinclair, it states the various ways the factory would use or cover up spoiled meat. In the text it states, "" Jonas told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed..."" (Sinclair par.2).  From the text it\'s shown that the workers would use baking soda to take away the strong odor of the sour meat, and even used chemistry to give it a more fresh taste and odor. This method saved the company money, but was wrong because it was selling people spoiled meat that could possibly make them sick. In paragraph 2 it also states, ""... some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle with destroyed the odor--a process known to the workers as \'giving them thirty percent\'"" (Sinclair par.2). When the speech from the meat was bad enough workers would also use a machine to fill the meat with pickle to help rid of the doors. They would use much stronger pickle, and still end up selling the spoiled meat. In the end, the ways they would cover up the spoiled meat is by using baking soda, pickle, or chemistry to help rid of the doors to sell spoiled meat to consumers. ', 'Some of the ways factories would use spoiled meat is by: mixing it with other meat and turning it into sausage or even using soda to ""conceal"" the rotting smell of it. In the first paragraph Sinclair talks about how his superior would encourage workers to do so in order to make the most out of the meat. In the second paragraph, in the beginning, the process in which sticky, rotten meat would be covered up started with being rubbed with soda. ', 'There was various ways the factory would use and cover up spoiled meat. One way the factory did this in the beginning was by chopping it up and making it into sausage. In the text it says the meat couldn\'t be used for anything else so sausage was their last resort. Another way they covered up spoiled meat was by using chemicals. In the text it says ""Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pile would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose."" This goes to show chemicals played a role in the process, but not only did they make it into sausage and use chemicals, they also would pump the meat. Over time the factory gained control over a second pickle one much stronger than the first and this one got rid of the odor of the meat completely making the price rise thory cents because the meat didn\'t smell. Although the meat was already contaminated and spoiled enough, they even furthered and used the skin of the oldest hogs. This skin wasn\'t very appealing to the eye or probably the sense of touch so they would chop it up into finer pieces and call it ""head cheese"". The last process of the factory occured when the meat was completely spoiled mold and all. The text says ""it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."". This is the last way the factory covered up their spoiled meat. ', 'The factory would drown the spoiled meat in soda, and major chemicals. In the story Jonas had told them how the meat is fixed when spoiled.', 'Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose. In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus', 'One factor would be to rub it in soda to take away the smell. They would take the ham would be smoked if the smell was really bad.', 'They would put it in sausage (lines 6-9) and they would cover it in soda to get rid of the odor (paragraph 2 line 2)', 'The factory had done a system called pickling hams, which was supposed to preserve them, yet, they were found to be spoiled. One way they would have taken the odor off was to rub it with soda to take the smell away (paragraph 2).  Another one is that if the spoiled meat that has been pickled or gone bad, then they have the bad part cut out and turned into ""boneless ham"" (paragraph 2).  These were then sold and eaten on free lunch counters. Furthermore,  when the whole meat was bad the meat factories would chop it up with other meat and then add in borax and glycerin into the hoppers to cover up spoiled meat (paragraph  3).  The meat was never taken care of properly and they were disgusting, which led them to use or cover up spoiled meat.', 'One way the factories would cover up the usage of spoiled meat is to add it to the fresh meat.  To the factories there was only positives from their perspective; there was more to sell and less waste to get rid of. The article states on paragraph 3 that ""...mixed with half a ton of other meat...""', 'They would stick hot irons in spoiled ham to make it less noticeable, mix spoiled meat with rotten meat and sell it off, rub meat with chemicals to make it last longer, etc.', 'they would rub soda on them they also would solve them in the packages. ""Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and  how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be dated on free- lunch counters.""', 'It\'s no doubt that the factory was deceitful to the public when it came to the meat pre-ration but they also endangered the public by using hazardous and sanitary practices. In the article it states that they used practices such as ""There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs."" These practices were not limited to the sanitary environment that the employees had to work under. having no place to wash their hands influenced the employees into ""washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the sausage."" These quotes create an emphasis on the sanitary practices. when it came to the meat however it became more and more apparent that the factory did not care about ethical practices because it was about the money. "" These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together."" This would create more meat and it would get rid of the rats therefore it was seen as a good thing to do. meat that was spoiled would be mixed in with good meat and covered with chemicals in order to prevent awareness of the fact that it was really bad meat. Another form of covering up rotten meat would be taking out the bone where the rotten part was found and inserting a white-hot iron. this would erase the visible trace of rotten and or spoiled meat.

The factory started making boneless hams, skinned hams, california hams, and many different cuts of meat.  Lastly,  the factory would make sausage out of all of the leftover. They would grind up the meat into small pieces and no one could tell what was really in them.  In conclusion, the factory had many ways to use or cover up the spoiled meat.

To solve this issue, the packers used a stronger pickle. After smoking the hams, some would be found to have gone bad but were still sold to the public as ""Number Three Grade"". To solve this problem, they decided to extract the bone and insert a white-hot iron, getting rid of all but Number One Grade. To be able to keep selling to the general public, the packers made up numerous schemes and ""they had what they called \'boneless hams,\' which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and \'California hams,\' which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy \'skinned hams,\' which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no  one would buy them--that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled \'head cheese!\'"" (Sinclair p 2).

Since spoiled meat had a very strong odor to it, workers within factories had to ensure that consumers would not be able to smell it so that they would be more likely to buy and consume it. As a result, they used sweet smelling or colorless products in order to mask the speech. Hams were pickled with a machine that was both quick and effective, but would sometimes spoil the meat further. This detail further helped to support Sinclair\'s claim that factories mainly cared about making a profit rather than the health of their consumers. Additionally, factory workers used methods of hiding or covering up spoiled meat by making it more subtle through covering it with spoiled meat or chopping it into smaller pieces so it would go unnoticed by consumers. Lastly, Sinclair describes how spoiled ham was especially covered up through selling bad ham as ""Number Three Grade"" or ""smoked ham"". Later however, ""they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron"" (Sinclair 1906).

It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together. This is no fairy story and no joke; the meat would be shoveled into carts, and the man who did the shoveling would not trouble to lift out a rat even when he saw one – there were things that went into the sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit."" Just imagine getting all of those germs served on your plate for breakfast. The idea is nauseating.

Sinclair states that ""some ingenious person had hit upon a new device"" where they would ""extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay"" in order to get rid of grades for the meats (Sinclair 2). Even though a bad part of the meat was being extracted, the way it was done was still sanitary and it was used as a scheme by the meatpacking industry to appeal to the greater population. The meatpacking industry found another way to increase productivity by ""fill[ing] a ham with pickle in a few seconds"" through the process of using a ""needle into the meat and working with his foot"" in order to make the meat last longer, even at the cost of ruining its sanitation (Sinclair 2). The fact that the workers would use their feet in the process indicated how the meatpacking industry was corrupt when it came to providing sanitary ham\'s to the population and that it would find any way possible to increase productivity and cover-up spoiled meat.

Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions- a-minute flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference"". This shows yet another way in which the factory would use spoiled meat, by cutting it up so that fresh meat could be mixed with a small amount of the spoiled meat, thus discussing the spoiled meat. In paragraph 4, it also states that ""There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs. There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it"".

Some of the hams would be given an extra/second pickle in hopes that it would be strong enough to destroy the odor. The workers had called this as ""giving them thirty per cent"".  They created odd processes as well, such as trying to ""extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert it in the hole a white-hot iron"". Lastly, they would also try and preserve the meat with bore and color it with gelatin for a browser color, and would even ""stamp some it ""special"", and for this they would charge two cents more a pound"". ', 'The factory would use several different ways to cover up spoiled meat and use it. One such way according to The Jungle was to, ""The packers were always originating such schemes—they had what they called “boneless hams,” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and “California hams,” which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out.""
